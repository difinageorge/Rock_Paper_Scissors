# ✊📄✂ Rock Paper Scissors Game – Java GUI

This project was completed as part of my **Java Programming Internship** at **System Tron** (Week 03).
The objective of this task was to create a **Java GUI-based Rock Paper Scissors game** where the player competes against the computer.
The application includes a **difficulty level selector** that changes the computer's playing style from purely random to strategically biased.

## 🚀 Live Demo

This is a Java desktop application, so there is no online demo available.
You can download and run the code locally on your machine to try it out.

## 📌 Task Objective

Develop a **GUI-based Java Rock Paper Scissors game** that:

* Allows the user to select difficulty (**Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard**).
* Lets the user choose **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** via buttons.
* Displays both the player's and computer's choices.
* Decides the round winner and updates the scoreboard.
* Makes the computer's moves **biased** based on the selected difficulty:

  * Easy → 100% random.
  * Medium → \~60% chance computer chooses a winning move.
  * Hard → \~85% chance computer chooses a winning move.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Java**

  * **Swing** – for GUI components.
  * **AWT** – for layouts and fonts.
  * **Random** – for computer's move generation.
  * **Event Handling** – for button clicks and game logic.
